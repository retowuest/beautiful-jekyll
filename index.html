        I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.uib.no/en/sampol">Department of Comparative Politics</a> at the <a href="https://www.uib.no/en">University of Bergen</a>. After research stays at Princeton University and New York University, I received my PhD in Political Science from the University of Geneva in 2016.

        <br />
        My primary research interests include political representation, political behavior, legislative politics, and quantitative methods. In my dissertation, I developed game-theoretic and statistical models to explore the reasons for and consequences of roll-call voting in legislatures.
